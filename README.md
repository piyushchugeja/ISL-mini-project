# ISL translator
This project focuses on developing a system to convert Indian Sign Language (ISL) into coherent sentences. We employ computer vision and deep learning techniques to interpret ISL gestures and translate them into text, bridging the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities in India. Our solution aims to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for the deaf population by providing a real-time ISL-to-sentence conversion tool. The project's success hinges on the training of a robust model capable of recognizing a wide range of ISL signs, contributing to a more inclusive and interconnected society.
